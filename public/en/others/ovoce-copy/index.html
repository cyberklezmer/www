<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
Trees, just trees...
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
<i>So, I guess I’ll live. Maybe in a wheelchair, but that’s life too,</i> Sebastian assessed his situation after being left alone. <i>But that’s just the worst-case scenario. It’s also possible that I’ll walk again... And I can certainly try to walk again... My senses seem to be intact, my mind works, so some meaningful future must exist... But what kind?</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
Sebastian, I hesitated for a long time whether and how to write to you. I even consulted a therapist, who advised me to write the letter first and then decide whether to send it or not. If you’re holding it in your hand, then I sent it, otherwise, it’s lying in one of my secret places.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
As he was thinking, a window appeared on the screen with the header <b>New message</b>. Against his will, he also read the second line: <b>From: Mom, Re: Birthday</b>. <i>She forgot to turn off synchronization… I should probably turn off the tablet quickly...</i> ... 
<b>Upcoming event: Date.</b> ... <i>I should really stop,</i> he thought and put the tablet back in the nightstand.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
<i>I’m stopping! Clearly, I’m playing with dangerous things here!</i> He spent the whole morning with such and similar thoughts. But then he began to see things from the other side. <i>After all, it’s nothing more than some suppressed fears from childhood.</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
Instead of panic, he was overwhelmed by an intense feeling of pity. For the lost future. For the wasted past. For the mental state he was leaving in. <i>That’s so unfair!</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
“So you believe those hyenas too? Even after we explained it a thousand times?”
<b>See how angry he gets? He doesn’t have a clear conscience.</b>
“Well, there’s no smoke without fire. But it’s not just that, it’s also about the court case.”
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
The screen showed a scene similar to the one they had just witnessed – the same hospital, the same park, the only difference was that the ambulance wasn’t taking the patient away but bringing them in. The scene cut to a doctor’s office.
“Some polytrauma just arrived.” the nurse reported with a phone to her ear.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
<b>For instance, in Jung, the biggest bait is active imagination. It seems harmless, people try it, and they’re ours...</b>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
Look, I’ve read it all. In my opinion, it’s a mishmash. ... The things it deals with, ninety percent of men have sorted out by the time they’re twenty, and those who haven’t will feel awkward reading it. ... It’s a bit of everything, and each aspect is weak. ... And the fact that they cleverly include a scathing review of themselves in their own work just adds the final touch of awkwardness.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
One should never give up if there’s any hope.

<p>Well, it starts off well, but I’m not into the ghost stuff / The eroticism was good, that surprised me / The sex ... is terrible – seriously, can you think of anyone who can describe sex without making it awkward? / (guess the gender of the last two) / In the middle, Sebastian (the hero) seems to wander a bit / Pretty good for a debut / I’m curious what the reviewers will say / I broke my reader on page thirty / I really liked it, but maybe mainly because I had low expectations: I can imagine what it looks like when we scientists start writing / It made me think about the philosophical question of whether if a person forgets the event that led to their mental problems, they also get rid of those problems – I admit I skipped a bit / <strong><a href="https://www.volvox.cz/knihy/mimo/smid_po_ovoci_poznate_je.php" target="_blank">What about you?</a></strong></p>
